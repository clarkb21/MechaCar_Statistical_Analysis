- **Which variables provide a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?** 
  1. Vehicle length, ground clearance, and the y-intercept have the highest impact on the mpg values in the datset. 
  2. Vehicle weight also seems to most likely provide non-random amount of variance, but not on the same scale as vehicle length. 
- **Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero?**
  1. The slope of the linear regression model would not be zero.
  2. The p-value is extremely small, much smaller than the standard significance level of .05. 
  3. Therefore, we have sufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis, meaning that the slope of the line is not zero.
- **Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively?** 
  1. Yes, this linear model does predict the Mechcar prototypes effectively due to the high r-squared value. 
  2. An r-squared value of .7149 indicates that roughly 71% of the variability of the mpg variable is explained using this model.
